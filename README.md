# latex snippets
 my latex snippets :)

I will be updating my latex snippets throughout time. Feel free to use this code for using latex for notes and in vscode! I had a difficult time trying to find other people's snippets specifically for latex so here is my own version for now :). I also based it off from https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets. Thanks for seeing this repo!
