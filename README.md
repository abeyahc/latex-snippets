# latex snippets
 my latex snippets :)

I will be updating my latex snippets throughout time. Feel free to use this code for using latex for notes and in vscode! I had a difficult time trying to find other people's snippets specifically for latex so here is my own version for now :). I also based it off from https://github.com/gillescastel/latex-snippets and https://github.com/Einlar/latex_snippets/tree/master/vscode. Just adding more to his latex.json file basically and tweaking to my personal preferences. Have fun!
